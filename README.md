# Simplified Pedestrian Crossing Prediction System

### Abstract
*Pedestrian intention estimation is an open key challenge in assistive and autonomous driving systems for urban environments. An intelligent system should be able to understand the intentions of pedestrians and predict their forthcoming actions in real-time. To date, only a few public datasets have been proposed for the purpose of studying pedestrian behavior prediction in the context of intelligent driving. This project leverages the JAAD dataset, which contains annotated video sequences of pedestrian behaviors, to develop a simplified yet effective model for predicting pedestrian crossing behavior leveraging computer vision techniques. Using bounding box annotations to track pedestrian movements across frames of the dataset video sequences, our approach employs a modified version of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to analyze spatial and temporal patterns. The model outputs a binary prediction—whether a pedestrian will cross the street within a given timeframe—offering a direct solution to the complex challenge of pedestrian intention prediction. We evaluate our model's performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, recall and F1-score. This project aims to provide a simplified and extendable version of a method that not only contributes to the enhancement of safety in intelligent autonomous driving systems, but also serves as an instructive example of applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to understand and predict real-world pedestrian behaviors.*
